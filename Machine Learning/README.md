# Machile learning algorithms comparison

In this script we will apply and compare different machine learning algorithms in order to perform predictions. As an example of use, we are using the omic data generated by The Cancer Genome Atlas Network (TCGA). Data includes 150 samples of RNA-seq previously filtered and normalized. In this case we aim to define a model to predict different types of breast cancer Basal, Her2 y LumA. You can find this data in the **rna.csv** file.
