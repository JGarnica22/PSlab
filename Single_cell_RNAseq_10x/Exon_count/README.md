# scRNAseq data from cKO exon counting
With these scripts you can make a new genome reference for cellranger count in order to count indepently each exon reads from a single-cell RNA-seq 10X run.
Note that if exon length is too short some exons might not be counted properly.
The purpouse of this is to assess the effectivity of a conditional KO in each cell.
