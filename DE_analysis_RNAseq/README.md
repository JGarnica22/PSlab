# DE_analysis_RNAseq

This script can be used to perform differential expression analysis (DE) on RNAseq data using DESeq2 pacjage from Bioconductor.
The package estimate variance-mean dependence in count data from high-throughput sequencing assays and test for differential expression based on a model using the negative binomial distribution.

What it will perform: DE, PCA, Volcano, etc.

Explain paramaters that need to be specified at the beginning, etc.
