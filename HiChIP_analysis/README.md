# HiChIP analysis :thread:

This pipeline should be used to analyse HiChIP data. Briefly, HiChIP is a technique used to identify regions that are in contact in the 3D structure of the genome. In particular, we are connecting promoters to the regions they are connected to by using a promoter enrichment procedure in the HiChIP protocol (see reference in /doc).

HiChIP data can be analysed using the HiC-Pro pipeline from Servant (for more information see [documentation](http://nservant.github.io/HiC-Pro/QUICKSTART.html) or their [GitHub page](https://github.com/nservant/HiC-Pro)).
