# R and RStudio SetUp :octocat:

R is a powerful open source program for statistics and graphics. It can run on pretty much any computer and has a very active and friendly support community online.<br/>

RStudio is an integrated development environment (IDE) for R. It’s basically a nice front-end for R, giving you a console, a scripting window, a graphics window, and an R workspace, among other options.<br/>

**Install R and RStudio**<br/>
Installing R on Windows or Mac is very straightforward. The easiest way is to install it through CRAN.<br/>

To download and install R and RStudio follow these steps:

1. Download R from http://cran.us.r-project.org/ (click on “Download R for Windows” or "Download R for Mac OS X)
2. In the subdirectory "base" chose "Install R for the first time".
3. You will obtain a file named "R-3.6.3-win.exe" or similar depending on the version of R that you download.
4. Run the .exe file. Leave all default settings in the installation options, so click the button 'Next' until the process is complete.
5. Download RStudio from http://rstudio.org/download/desktop and install it ("Download RStudio Desktop"). 
6. You will obtain a file named "RStudio-1.2.5033.exe" or similar (again depending on the version).
7. Run the .exe file with the default settings by clicking 'Next', and wait until the installation finishes (bear in mind that RStudio requires that R is installed beforehand).
