# R and RStudio SetUp :octocat:

R is a powerful open source program for statistics and graphics. It can run on pretty much any computer and has a very active and friendly support community online.
RStudio is an integrated development environment (IDE) for R. Itâ€™s basically a nice front-end for R, giving you a console, a scripting window, a graphics window, and an R workspace, among other options.
