# How to use Markdown

Markdown is a lightweight markup language with plain-text-formatting syntax. Its design allows it to be converted to many output formats, but the original tool by the same name only supports HTML. Markdown is often used to format readme files, for writing messages in online discussion forums, and to create rich text using a plain text editor.<br/>

### Headings
To create a heading, add number signs (#) in front of a word or phrase. The number of number signs you use should correspond to the heading level. For eaxh extra (#) that you use your heading will be smaller.<br/>

### Paragraphs
To create paragraphs, use a blank line to separate one or more lines of text.<br/>

### Line breaks
To create a line break (<br>), end a line with two or more spaces, and then type return.<br/>

## Emphasis
### Bold
To bold text, add two asterisks or underscores before and after a word or phrase. To bold the middle of a word for emphasis, add two asterisks without spaces around the letters. 

### Italic
To italicize text, add one asterisk or underscore before and after a word or phrase. To italicize the middle of a word for emphasis, add one asterisk without spaces around the letters.

### Bold and Italic
To emphasize text with bold and italics at the same time, add three asterisks or underscores before and after a word or phrase. To bold and italicize the middle of a word for emphasis, add three asterisks without spaces around the letters.

## Ordering
### Bullet Points
To create bullet points add a hypen and a space before the word or sentence to write.

### List
To create an ordered list, add line items with numbers followed by periods. The numbers donâ€™t have to be in numerical order, but the list should start with the number one.
