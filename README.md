# PSlab :dna: :microbe: :microscope: :petri_dish:

This repository contains all scripts and data used in the lab to perform RNAseq, ATACseq, and ChIPseq data analysis. <br />

## :warning: BEFORE STARTING 
</br>
Create in your computer a folder for your specific project, this folder must contain the following subfolders: <br />
  * data -> it will contain all your raw data to be used for the analysis <br />
  * doc -> documentation useful for the project (papers, manuals...) <br />
  * figs -> where all the figures rendered over the analysis will be generated <br />
  * output -> tables and matrixs generated from the analysis in txt or excel format <br />
  * R -> it contains the script(s) used for the specific analysis <br />

## In GitHub :octocat:
<br />
Each project will be in a different folder. In the folder you will find a README that explains all you need to perform that specific analysis, including necessary data, documentation, how to use the script, output files and figs, etc. <br />

1. After you created your directory in your computer, download data and script(s) following instructions in the README and put them in the corresponding subfolders of your project. <br /> 
2. To run the scripts, always first revisit parameters that need to be changed for each analysis (e.g. directory, input files, conditions, etc.). <br />
3. Each project will contain also an MD file in case you want to run the analysis and get a single pdf report with all the figures and tables. <br />
